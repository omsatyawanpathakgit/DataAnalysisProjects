This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates Transductive Component Analysis (TCA) — a domain adaptation technique used in transfer learning. The notebook walks through the end-to-end process using a dataset that initially requires preprocessing (like replacing blanks and zero-tenure entries), followed by domain adaptation using TCA.

**Notebook Highlights:**
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Implementation of Transductive Component Analysis (TCA)
Evaluation of domain adaptation performance
